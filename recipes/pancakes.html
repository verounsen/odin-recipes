    <div class="ingredients-block">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sparkling water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the egg and milk mixture into the dry ingredients while whisking continuously. Make sure to mix until you have a smooth, lump-free batter.</li>
        <li>Stir in the melted butter into the batter. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Let the batter rest for about 15-20 minutes. This resting time allows the gluten to relax and results in softer pancakes.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. You can lightly grease the surface with butter or cooking spray if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the hot skillet. Tilt the skillet gently to spread the batter into a circular shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancake for about 1-2 minutes on one side or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the pancake using a spatula and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter or cooking spray to the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the warm pancakes with your favorite toppings. Traditional toppings include lingonberry jam, fresh berries, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</li>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious and fluffy Norse pancakes! <br>They are perfect for breakfast, brunch, or as a sweet treat any time of the day.</p>
